Tuesday
-------------------------------------------------------
Currently only displaying one post from the route.
A single return does match the desired state

Need to add to routes for single page or create new comment route that returns
all comments on a given post(adding comments to the post to_dict makes most sense to me)

Getting similar behavior as before (issue now with single post route I believe)

started styling page for a post(used a bandaid to get render)

need to create submit post form and component/hook it up

need to create a create comment form/hook it up

need to hook up/style user profile page

need to create carousel

need to figure out styling on image-grid

need to create search component and add search functionality.

---------------------------------------------------------
Two days to go!
